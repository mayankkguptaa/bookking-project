            How often do you think of reading a book again? Very few of us have a tendency to read a
            book all over again. Mostly it is lying here and there with a coat of dust. We once read
            a book completely, it becomes an ignorable entity to us while someone out there may need it
            more than us. Then why not help those who need it more and make a few bucks at the same time!!
            Sell them off. Or else if you feel that you may need the book sometime you can put it for rent
            as well. Also, you need not to worry as we have covered all the security norms to make
            you feel safe while giving your book to someone else.

          <h2>Buy Books from Here</h2>
          <p>
            Books always tells the same story whether you are first or tenth reader of the book,
            that's why books are special. Then why not rent or buy a book from someone rather than
            purchasing a new copy. Whenever you go to purchase a new copy it increases demand of books
            and to fulfill this demand more trees are cut down. And trees being the factor of
            replenishment of oxygen in the atmosphere are something which we should consider to save
            at any cost. Not everybody participates in the "cut 1 and plant four trees" type of
            policies but they can add to it by reducing the demand of pages that is by reusing
            the books.

      <p>
        Book bank have the facility for all students to get books within an educational unit.
        The Books from the Book Bank are issued for the whole year or each semester.
        Student members can issue books for whole year or semester. And after the books are returned
        back to the system books are refurbished and then recirculated to the new batch.
        It has many benefits over the current system as it reduced the cost of having the books for
        education and also it saves the wastage of books i.e papers which are made from cutting down
        of trees.
